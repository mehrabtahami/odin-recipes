    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      I get a fair number of video ideas watching food travel television shows.
      During these productions, it's not uncommon for the host to heap praise on
      the local offerings, but Stanley Tucci (in his new show, Searching for
      Italy) took this to another level, calling the dish, "life changing,"
      "unbelievable," and "one of the best things I've ever eaten." I love a
      good vegetable-based pasta, so I decided to give this a try. But there was
      one small problem: It requires the zucchini to be deep-fried first.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Â¼ cup warm water</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon active dry yeast</li>
      <li>1 cup cold water</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>3 cups bread flour</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Make the dough: Pour warm water into a large bowl, then sprinkle yeast
        over the top. Let stand for 5 minutes. Stir in cold water and salt. Stir
        in flour, 1 cup at a time until incorporated.
      </li>
      <li>Knead dough on a floured surface until smooth, about 10 minutes.</li>
      <li>
        Divide in half and form into two tight dough balls. Coat with olive oil
        and refrigerate in a sealed container for at least 16 hours. Be sure to
        use a big enough container to allow dough to rise.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make the pizzas: Remove dough from the refrigerator one hour prior to
        using.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven, with a pizza stone on the lowest rack, to 550 degrees
        F (288 degrees C). Lightly dust a pizza peel with flour.
      </li>
      <li>
        Prepare the first pizza: Lightly dust one dough ball with flour and
        stretch gradually until about 14 inches in diameter, or about the size
        of the pizza stone. Place on the floured peel.
      </li>
      <li>
        Lay 1/2 of the mozzarella on the crust, then sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon
        oregano and 1/8 teaspoon pepper over the top. Randomly arrange 1/4 cup
        crushed tomatoes over the pizza, leaving some empty areas, then drizzle
        1 tablespoon olive oil over top.
      </li>
      <li>
        With a quick back and forth jerk, make sure dough will release from the
        peel easily. Place the tip of the peel at the back of the preheated
        pizza stone, and remove the peel so that the pizza is left on the stone.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until the crust begins to brown, 4 to 6
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Slide the pizza onto the peel and remove from the oven; then slide off
        the peel onto a work surface. Sprinkle 1/2 of the basil leaves randomly
        over the pizza. Cut into wedges and serve.
      </li>
    </ol>
